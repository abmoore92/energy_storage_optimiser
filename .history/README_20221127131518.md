# Optimisation Project for Battery Sizing for a Given Load and Renewable Supply

## Context
A consumer with a given load profile and renewable production targets 100% self-reliance. A single battery is used to meet this storage requirement, with costs for the power (MW) and capacity (MWh) components. The battery is sized to reduce cost while meeting demand. Renewable curtailment is not considered, and it is assumed to be sold to the grid. 

The word "battery" is used throughout but refers to any given storage technology - this could be compressed air, hydrogen, or any other.

The target use case for this model, and therefore scenario design, is the compare the cost of different storages by researching and implementing different costs for the power (MW) and capacity (MWh) values.

### Limitations and Extensions
Cost
* Cost is currently capex only, this is a limited view as opex can differ between power and capacity components of a project.

Multi-year modelling
* The model currently looks at one timeseries, representing one typical year or operating period. In reality, multi-year variation plays an important effect, and should be considered. Currently this should be solved either by careful selection of the model year, or running multiple scenarios with different year inputs. A future version of the model should include multiple years into the simulation.

Multi-storage solutions
* Currently the model only considers 1 storage unit. It may be interesting to build 2 or more storages of different technologies to match short and longer duration demands for volatility management. A hybrid site may produce more efficient outcomes than using only one storage. Currently, the best way to solve this is to compare scenarios with different storages.

Excess renewables production has no value
* Excess renewables are in reality sold to the grid. The objective function for the model is simiplistic in that it targets self-reliance. A more interesting question is to find the economic sensitivity of % of self reliance. This would require including market prices for energy sold.

Scenario Management
* Data connectivity is currently manual, the user needs to download data from external sources and create their own connection. Results are also similarly not stored and managed.
* Data input should be connected to external sources that provide relevant data - such as the API for ENTSO-E for demand profiles.
* Sensitivity analysis of key metrics should be automated in the model run
* Results should be stored in a standardised structure and a simple dashboard built to enable scenario comparison.
* Model and results are currently stored within the same notebook - a future version should separate code into modules:
    1. Data ingest
    2. Model creation and simulation
    3. Data output
    4. Analysis and graphs - dashboard of key results
